I am a postdoctoral researcher, working with [Maryam Kamgarpour](https://people.epfl.ch/maryam.kamgarpour?lang=en) in the [Systems Control and Multiagent Optimization Research](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/sycamore/) lab. I am broadly interested in research related to online decision-making, with a particular interest in Multi-agent systems and Game theory. 

I defended my PhD in 2023 at [Inria Scool](https://team.inria.fr/scool/) (ex SequeL), working with [Odalric Maillard](http://odalricambrymmaillard.neowordpress.fr/) and [Vianney Perchet](https://vianney.ai/). During my PhD, I focused on reinforcement learning theory and multi-armed bandits. In 2022, I interned at [Amazon Alexa](https://www.amazon.science/tag/alexa) where I worked with NLU teams to improve the ``N-best hypothesis ranking'' using LLMs and bandits' techniques.

Prior to my Ph.D., I graduated from [Ã‰cole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) with engineering and Master's degrees, and I later obtained the [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/) Master's degree from ENS Paris-Saclay. For more information, here is [my resume](https://redaouhamma.github.io/files/Reda_resume.pdf).

## Research interests
Reinforcement learning theory, multi-agent systems, and applications of RL and bandits in real life.
