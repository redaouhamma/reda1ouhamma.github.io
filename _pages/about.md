## About me
I am a Postdoctoral researcher at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/fr/), working with [Maryam Kamgarpour](https://people.epfl.ch/maryam.kamgarpour?lang=en) in the [Systems Control and Multiagent Optimization Research](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/sycamore/) lab. I am broadly interested in research related to online decision-making, with a particular interest in Multi-agent systems and Game theory. 

Prior, I defended my Ph.D. at [Inria Scool](https://team.inria.fr/scool/) (ex SequeL), working with [Odalric Maillard](http://odalricambrymmaillard.neowordpress.fr/) and [Vianney Perchet](https://vianney.ai/). I focused on RL and multi-armed bandits and worked on improving the theoretical understanding and relaxing modeling assumptions. During my Ph.D., I interned at [Amazon Alexa](https://www.amazon.science/tag/alexa) where I worked with the NLU team to improve the N-best hypothesis ranking using LLMs and Multi-armed-bandit techniques.

Before my Ph.D., I graduated from [Ã‰cole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) with an engineer's and Master's degree, and I obtained the [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/) Master's degree from ENS Paris-Saclay. For more information, here is [my resume](https://redaouhamma.github.io/files/Reda_resume.pdf).

## Research interests
Reinforcement learning theory, multi-agent systems, and well-motivated applications of RL and bandits.
