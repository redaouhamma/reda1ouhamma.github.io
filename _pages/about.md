I am a PhD candidate at the Inria Lille’s Scool team (ex SequeL), under the supervision of [Odalric Maillard](http://odalricambrymmaillard.neowordpress.fr/) (CNRS / Inria Lille) and [Vianney Perchet](https://vianney.ai/) (ENSAE / Criteo AI Lab). Before my PhD, I graduated from École Polytechnique and ENS Paris-Saclay.

I am interested in research related to bandits, reinforcement learning, and online learning. [My resume][redaouhamma.github.io/files/Reda_resume.pdf]
