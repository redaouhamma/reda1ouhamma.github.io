I am a Postdoctoral researcher at EPFL, working with [Maryam Kamgarpour](https://people.epfl.ch/maryam.kamgarpour?lang=en) in the [Systems Control and Multiagent Optimization Research](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/sycamore/) lab. I am broadly interested in research related to online decision-making, with a particular interest in Multi-agent systems and Game theory. 

Prior, I defended my Ph.D. at the Inria Lille’s [Scool team](https://team.inria.fr/scool/) (ex SequeL), under the supervision of [Odalric Maillard](http://odalricambrymmaillard.neowordpress.fr/) and [Vianney Perchet](https://vianney.ai/). During my Ph.D., I focused on reinforcement learning and multi-armed bandits, with a special interest in improving the theoretical understanding and relaxing unrealistic modeling assumptions. During my Ph.D., I interned at [Amazon Alexa](https://www.amazon.science/tag/alexa) where I worked with the natural language understanding team to improve the N-best hypothesis ranking and content recommendation using LLMs and Multi-armed-bandit techniques.

Before my Ph.D., I graduated from [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) with an engineer's and Master's degree, and I also obtained the [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/) Master's degree from ENS Paris-Saclay.

Research interests: Sequential decision-making, multi-agent systems, applications of RL and bandits. [My resume](http://redaouhamma.github.io/files/Reda_resume.pdf)
